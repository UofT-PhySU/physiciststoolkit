# Physicist's Tool Kit

# Read this before use
This is a repository meant to curate some QoL (Quality of Life) scripts that <ins>***are not directly related to homeworks***.</ins> For example, something that generates LaTeX tables from .csv files is okay, but a numerical integrator that resembles a PHY407 homework assignment is not. To prevent you or your peers from accidentally committing academic offense (AO), please make a new branch of this repository and wait for admins to review your pull request, rather than directly committing to `main`.
